            <p>When someone in your life comes out as trans, it’s incredibly easy to worry for them. There’s a lot about transitioning that is very rough, and for someone who isn’t trans it may seem like the risks outweigh the benefits. It doesn’t help that transitioning seems like a new modern thing that people may come to regret further down the line. </p> 
            <p style="margin-top: 100px">The good news is that these fears are unfounded. </p>

                <p>Only 2% of people who start transitioning end up deciding they aren't actually trans (Turban). This is far less than the 8% of people who regret having kids and the 24% who regret getting a tattoo (Piotrowski and Schaeffer).</p>
                <p style="font-size:xx-small;">For the sake of journalistic integrity, it must be noted that the total regret rate of all transitions is slightly higher at 13.1%, however that percentage includes the 82.5% of people who regret their choice due to pressure from other people such as family and friends. 2.1% is the far more important number as it does not include these external factors.</p>

                <p class="mapText">Many people are also afraid that transitioning is just a modern thing that will come to pass. They believe that transitioning is a process that was invented recently, and that in a few years it will have been a fad that died out. This could be further from the truth. While not often talked about or taught in schools, transitioning has a long and deep history that stretches back to the invention of written language, and most likely goes much further beyond.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right; font-size: small;"> - Qalonymos ben Qalonymos, 1322 (translated by Peter Cole)</p>
                <p class="pWithSpacing">Qalonymos was a poet who was born male in 1286, and after regretting his gender all his life, died male. If Qalonymos had been born today, with access to the internet and the ability to learn about transitioning, he would have done so. The only reason he (and the millions of people across history who wished to be a different gender) didn’t transition was because they were unfamiliar with the idea. The modern internet allows greater connection than ever before, family can keep in touch easier, friends can find each other, and people who desperately want to transition can learn from those who have gone through the process.</p>
                <p>I was in a similar position to Qalonymos when I was a kid. I wished, desperately, that I was a woman instead of a man, and like Qalonymos I often prayed to god to grant my wish. Unfortunately, no divine intervention came. It was only after I started using social media and came into contact with countless trans people talking about their experiences that I began to realize what it was that I could do to fulfill my wish. Without the internet I never would have realized that I could transition, and as such would, in the words of Qalnymos, I would “suffer until I wither away and die”.</p>

            <section id="mesopotamia" style="display: none;">
                <p>In Ancient Mesopotamia transitioning was viewed as a holy process bestowed by the goddess Ishtar. She was believed to have the power to change men into women, and women into men. Because of this, many trans people worshipped Ishtar, and her priestesses were often made up of trans women.</p>

                 <p>Does the photo above represent a man or a woman? From the curved face and suggestion of breasts, many would guess that it depicts a woman, however the figure is named Ur-Nanshe, which was a male name. Because of this, it is believed the figure depicts a trans or non-binary singer.</p>

            <section id="NA" style="display: none;">
                <p>Long before Columbus arrived on the scene, Native Americans had already begun accepting trans people in their community, calling them “two-spirit” for the belief they had a male and female spirit in them. Because of this balance, they held a valuable place in the community as mediators, able to see both sides of an argument and find a solution.</p>
                <p>With the USA’s negative view of transitioning, many Native American tribes became less accepting of transitioning, and started to look down on it in an attempt to appease the settlers. This led to an interesting situation where grandparents were the most accepting of trans people in Native American tribes because they were raised to be accepting of two-spirit folk while the newer generations didn’t. This is the obvious of what has occurred in most of the western world, where it has been the younger generation that has been the most accepting of trans people. Fortunantly with the greater acceptance of trans people worldwide, Native American tribes are once again accepting of their two-spirit members.</p>

        <section id="conclussion" style="padding-bottom: 100px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
            <p>There are many arguments against transitioning that trans people can hear when they come out as trans, but there are very few, if any, that carry much merit. Instead, most of them are misused and incorrect arguments used as reasoning to block trans people’s access to important treatment such as puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and bottom surgery.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Being trans is an incredibly mentally challenging experience, the hatred and disdain one feels at their own body and sense of self pre-transition is an enormous burden. Additionally, the politicalization and hatred thrown towards our very existence places even more burden on top of the pile. Because of this, trans people have incredibly high suicide and self harm rates. 42% of all trans people have attempted suicide, and 56% have engaged in self harm. Being accepting of someone’s transition is a small, but incredibly impactful thing that you can do to help any trans people in your life you care about. Not being trans is not an option, as it is a part of who one is. Technically, they could choose not to transition, but they would live out the rest of their life hating who they are, a fate I would not wish on even my worst enemies.</p>
