            </section>
            <section id="rightOrangeBar">
                <p style="text-align: left;">Only 2% of people who start transitioning end up changing their mind about being trans (Turban). This is far less than the 8% of people who regret having kids and the 24% who regret getting a tattoo (Piotrowski and Schaeffer). If someone comes out to you as trans, and you push back against them in case they regret it more than you would push back against someone having a kid, you’re overreacting. Transitioning is something that very few people wish they hadn’t done, and not something you need to be worried about. Instead, overly pushing back against someone’s transition may be viewed as you not being accepting of them, something that can be hurtful to people that are transitioning.</p>
                <p style="font-size:xx-small;">For the sake of integrity, it must be noted that the total regret rate of all transitions is higher at 13.1%, however that percentage includes the 82.5% of people who regret their choice due to a lack of acceptance from other people such as family and friends. 2.1% represents a far more important statistic as it does not include these external factors that this website is attempting to remove.</p>

                <p class="mapText">Many people are afraid that transitioning is just a modern thing that will come to pass. They believe that transitioning was invented recently, and that in a few years it will have been a fad that died out. This couldn't be further from the truth. While not often talked about or taught in schools, transitioning has a long and rich history that stretches back to the invention of written language, and most likely goes much further beyond.</p>

                <p style=" text-align: center;"><i>Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane by Heinrich Hofmann</i></p>
                <p class="pWithSpacing" style="margin-top: 75px;">Qalonymos was a poet who was born male in 1286, and after regretting his gender all his life, died male. If he had been born today, with access to the internet, he would have undoubtedly transitioned. The only reason he (and the millions of people across history who wished to be a different gender) didn’t transition was because they were unfamiliar with the idea.</p>
                <p>I was in a similar position to Qalonymos when I was a kid. I wished, desperately, that I had been born a woman instead of a man, and like Qalonymos I often prayed to god to grant me my wish. Unfortunately, no divine intervention came. However after I started using social media and came into contact with countless trans people talking about their experiences, I began to realize how I could fulfill my wish. Without the internet I never would have transitioned, but I would have suffered through the rest of my life as male, not knowing how to fix it.</p>

                <p>The oldest written records ever found come from Ancient Mesopotamia, and several of these records mention transitioning, and its relation to the goddess Ishtar.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;  margin-bottom: 50px; text-align: center;"><i>A clay tablet depicting the goddess Ishtar stepping on a lion</i></p>
                <p>In Ancient Mesopotamia transitioning was viewed as a holy process bestowed by Ishtar. The people of Mesopotamia believed she held the power to change men into women, and women into men. Because of this, trans people often worshipped Ishtar, and many trans women were included in her female priestesses, referred to as the gala (Daniels).</p>

                <p>Long before Columbus arrived on the scene, Native Americans had already begun accepting trans people in their community, calling them “two-spirit” for the belief they had a male and female spirit in them. Because of this balance, they held a valuable place in the community as mediators, able to see both sides of an argument and find a solution.</p>
                <img src="images/Wewha.png" alt="A black and white photograph of a two-spirit Native American" style="margin-top: 50px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 50px; text-align: center;"><i>A photograph of We'wha, a cultural ambassador of the Zuni Native American tribe</i></p>
                <p>With the USA’s negative view of transitioning, many Native American tribes became less accepting of transitioning, and started to look down on it in an attempt to appease the settlers. This led to an interesting situation where grandparents were the most accepting of trans people in Native American tribes, as they were raised to be accepting of two-spirit folk while the newer generations weren’t. This is the opposite of what has occurred in most of the western world, where the younger generation has been the most accepting of trans people. Fortunantly with the greater acceptance of trans people worldwide, Native American tribes are once again accepting of their two-spirit members (Jacobs).</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 100px;">Being trans is an incredibly mentally challenging experience, the hatred and disdain one feels at their own body and sense of self pre-transition places an enormous burden on trans people's shoulders. Additionally, the politicalization and hatred thrown towards our very existence places even more on top of the pile.</p>
                <p class="pWithSpacing" style=" text-align: center;">This unfortunately leads to trans people having extremely high rates of mental health problems compared to cis people.</p>

The only area in which cisgender people have a larger percentage is hazardous drinking">
                <p style="margin-top: 100px;">Of every category researched by a study (except for hazardous drinking), it was found that trans people have a higher rate of every mental health problem (Kidd). This study showed that 81% of trans people have experienced suicidal ideation, 42% have attempted suicide, and 56% have engaged in self-harm. These percentages are far higher than cis people’s respective 35%, 11%, and 12%.</p>
