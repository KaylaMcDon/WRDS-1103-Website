            <p>When someone in your life comes out as trans, it’s incredibly easy to worry for them. There’s a lot about transitioning that is very tough, and for someone who isn’t trans it may seem like the risks outweigh the benefits. It doesn’t help that transitioning seems like a new modern thing that people may come to regret further down the line.</p> 
            <p style="margin-top: 100px">The good news is that these fears are unfounded. </p>

                <p>Only 2% of people who start transitioning end up changing their mind about being trans (Turban). This is far less than the 8% of people who regret having kids and the 24% who regret getting a tattoo (Piotrowski and Schaeffer). If someone comes out to you as trans, and you push back against them in case they regret it more than you would push back against someone having a kid, you’re overreacting. Transitioning is something that very few people wish they hadn’t done, and not something you need to be worried about. Instead, overly pushing back against someone’s transition may be viewed as you not being accepting of them, something that can be hurtful for people transitioning.</p>
                <p style="font-size:xx-small;">For the sake of journalistic integrity, it must be noted that the total regret rate of all transitions is slightly higher at 13.1%, however that percentage includes the 82.5% of people who regret their choice due to a lack of acceptance from other people such as family and friends. 2.1% represents a far more important statistic as it does not include these external factors that this website is attempting to remove.</p>

                <p class="mapText">Many people are afraid that transitioning is just a modern thing that will come to pass. They believe that transitioning was invented recently, and that in a few years it will have been a fad that died out. This could be further from the truth. While not often talked about or taught in schools, transitioning has a long and rich history that stretches back to the invention of written language, and most likely goes much further beyond.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right; font-size: small;"> - Qalonymos ben Qalonymos, 1322 (translated by Peter Cole)</p>
                <p class="pWithSpacing">Qalonymos was a poet who was born male in 1286, and after regretting his gender all his life, died male. If he had been born today, with access to the internet, he would have undoubtedly transitioned. The only reason he (and the millions of people across history who wished to be a different gender) didn’t transition was because they were unfamiliar with the idea.</p>
                <p>I was in a similar position to Qalonymos when I was a kid. I wished, desperately, that I had been born a woman instead of a man, and like Qalonymos I often prayed to god to grant me my wish. Unfortunately, no divine intervention came.However after I started using social media and came into contact with countless trans people talking about their experiences, I began to realize how I could fulfill my wish. Without the internet I never would have transitioned, but I would have suffered through the rest of my life as male, not knowing how to fix it.</p>

                <p>The oldest written records ever found come from Ancient Mesopotamia, and several of these records mention transitioning, and its relation to the goddess Ishtar.</p>

                <p>In Ancient Mesopotamia transitioning was viewed as a holy process bestowed by the goddess Ishtarl. The people of Mesopotamia believed she held the power to change men into women, and women into men. Because of this, trans people often worshipped Ishtar, and many trans women were included in her female priestesses, referred to as the gala.</p>

                <p>Long before Columbus arrived on the scene, Native Americans had already begun accepting trans people in their community, calling them “two-spirit” for the belief they had a male and female spirit in them. Because of this balance, they held a valuable place in the community as mediators, able to see both sides of an argument and find a solution.</p>
                <img src="images/twoSpiritExample2.jpg" alt="2 side by side black and white photographs of a two spirit Native American, the pictures have a yellow tint, and there is a caption that reads &quot; O berdache Whe-Wa, da tribo Zuni, Novo México-EUA, foto de 1879." style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
                <p>With the USA’s negative view of transitioning, many Native American tribes became less accepting of transitioning, and started to look down on it in an attempt to appease the settlers. This led to an interesting situation where grandparents were the most accepting of trans people in Native American tribes because they were raised to be accepting of two-spirit folk while the newer generations didn’t. This is the obvious of what has occurred in most of the western world, where it has been the younger generation that has been the most accepting of trans people. Fortunantly with the greater acceptance of trans people worldwide, Native American tribes are once again accepting of their two-spirit members.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 200px; margin-bottom: 100px;">There are many arguments against transitioning that trans people can hear when they come out as trans, but there are very few, if any, that carry much merit. Instead, most of them are misused and incorrect arguments used as reasoning to block trans people’s access to important treatment such as puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and bottom surgery.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Being trans is an incredibly mentally challenging experience, the hatred and disdain one feels at their own body and sense of self pre-transition is an enormous burden. Additionally, the politicalization and hatred thrown towards our very existence places even more burden on top of the pile. Because of this, trans people have incredibly high suicide and self harm rates. 42% of all trans people have attempted suicide, and 56% have engaged in self harm. Being accepting of someone’s transition is a small, but incredibly impactful thing that you can do to help any trans people in your life you care about. Not being trans is not an option, as it is a part of who one is. Technically, they could choose not to transition, but they would live out the rest of their life hating who they are, a fate I would not wish on even my worst enemies.</p>
